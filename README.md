# Swedish Grade Calculator

The Swedish Grade Calculator is a React-based web application designed to calculate the merit value (jämförelsetal) for students in the Swedish education system. This tool allows users to input their course grades and receive their overall score, helping students gauge their eligibility for further education paths.
